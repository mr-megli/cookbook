# SimpleWeb

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

To run it, start the `python/simple_server` first and then run the Angular
application using `ng serve --proxy-config=proxy.conf.json` to make
sure that the Angular stack can access the backend.

The precise steps for creating the application were

```bash
$ ng new simple-web
$ cd simple-web
$ ng generate backend
```
